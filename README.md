# EmotionDetector

This is a React app which makes use of a Tensorflow.js model and user's webcam feed to classify emotions into 1 of the 7 categories - angry, disgusted, fearful, happy,
neutral, sad and surprised.

The model was trained on the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/msambare/fer2013">FER2013</a> dataset. 
The trained Tensorflow.js model is available <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JqrHcefUp24Uw5iI6bqSX4_zPFYd3XAt/view?usp=sharing">here</a>

The model was then uploaded to IBM Cloud Object Storage and accessed through the app.
